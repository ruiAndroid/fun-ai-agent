# fun-ai-agent Docs

This documentation area is powered by Nextra and mounted at `/docs`.

## What belongs here

- Platform-level architecture and workflows
- Control API and plane runbooks
- Per-instance and per-agent operating guides
- Contract references generated from `fun-ai-agent-contracts`

## Suggested structure for multi-agent claw instances

For each claw instance:

- Instance overview
- Agent catalog inside the instance
- Runtime policies and guardrails
- Troubleshooting and rollback procedures

Use stable docs for shared knowledge and keep runtime status in the control dashboard.
