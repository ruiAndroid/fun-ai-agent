# Claw Instance and Agent Model

## Domain model

- `Host`: physical or virtual machine running Docker
- `ClawInstance`: isolated runtime unit managed by control plane
- `Agent`: logical worker inside one claw instance
- `Task`: executable work unit assigned to an agent

## Mapping strategy

- One `ClawInstance` can host many agents
- Agents should expose stable metadata:
  - `agentId`
  - `agentType`
  - `version`
  - `capabilities`
- Keep instance-level lifecycle (`START`, `STOP`, `RESTART`, `ROLLBACK`) in control API
- Keep agent-level behavior docs and runbooks in this docs site

## Why this split works

- Dashboard: real-time operations and actions
- Docs: durable knowledge, standards, and troubleshooting context
