# Nextra Integration Blueprint

## Step 1: Keep `/` as dashboard and `/docs` as knowledge portal

- `/` keeps Ant Design-based control UI
- `/docs` hosts architecture, runbooks, and API docs

## Step 2: Add docs generation pipeline

- Input: `fun-ai-agent-contracts/openapi` and `schemas`
- Output: generated MDX under `src/content/reference`
- Trigger: CI on contracts version change

## Step 3: Add per-instance docs entry points

Recommended URL shape:

- `/docs/instances/{instanceId}`
- `/docs/instances/{instanceId}/agents/{agentId}`

Use these pages for curated operational guidance, not live metrics.

## Step 4: Keep source of truth boundaries clear

- Runtime truth: `fun-ai-agent-api` + `fun-ai-agent-plane`
- Documentation truth: `src/content` (or generated MDX committed by CI)

This keeps runtime APIs fast and docs navigation clean as agent count grows.
